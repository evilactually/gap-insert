Today I am happy to brag that I managed to pick a combination lock with 4 digits
in under half an hour in pretty much field conditions. No one could remember the code
so I thought I might as well try to brute force it. I was prepared for toilsome 
hours of going through 10 000 combinations, but then at 0650 I noticed that
latch badged in slightly more for some numbers and less for others. I assumed
it's because some elements of a mechanism were unblocked. I played with that
base combination 0650, changing some numbers and noting if the latch giving in
or not. I found that last two digits were best possible so I left them alone. 
For 0 and 6 I couldn't decide it didn't seem like they were contributing at all,
so I brute forced the last two digits, going through 100 combination 00 to 99, 
actually the number was 17, so not even that. I also later noticed that correct 
numbers had more slack then turned and they would give out sometimes a slight click
if you hold the latch while turning into number and then release the latch.
I discovered a first number on another lock that way, but didn't have time to pick 
the rest. So the code I discovered was 1750, but codes 1050, 1850 also worked for 
some reason. I wonder if it's a weakness of the mechanism, or a feature.
Anyway, inside the locked closet I found some free tonic for myself. Someone left
it for me, how thoughtful. How did they know I'd open the door.

The lock in question that got served today was "Master Lock 5400D Combination Key Safe".
