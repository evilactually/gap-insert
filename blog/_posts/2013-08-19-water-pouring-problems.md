There’s a class of puzzle problems known as water pouring problems. They are often posed as word problems involving <your favorite cartoon character here>, who is tasked to measure out a certain amount of liquid, usually his favorite drink, with scientific accuracy using a limited number of unmarked vessels of known capacities. Such problems are supposed to be hard and they are hard if done wrong even for a computer. I’ve seen some algorithms that can solve these problems pretty quickly, but those algorithms are hard for a human to perform on a piece of paper, from what i gathered it would involve drawing grids in multiple dimensions, and that doesn’t sound too practical. However i found a way to solve those puzzles by hand on paper using pretty basic arithmetic and it doesn’t take that much time or mental effort, but it may take some intuition. Unfortunately 
it's not a kind of algorithm a computer would be able to follow, so far I failed to find a consistent set of actions that works for every case. This 
is for human consumption only, so don't try to entice your nearest friendly computer to do it or it might die of infinite recursion.
